# Requirements

##

<br/>

Installing Graphql requires two plugins.
If none of them already exist, you can create one by executing the command:

<br/>

* Backend-Engine Plugin Instance
    
    ```bash
    $ node glue add backend-engine engine
    ```

<br/>

* Postgres Plugin Instance
    
    ```bash
    $ node glue add postgres postgres
    ```
