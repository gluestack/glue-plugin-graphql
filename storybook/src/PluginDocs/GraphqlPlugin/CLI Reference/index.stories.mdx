    <strong> graphql:console</strong>
  </summary>

  <br/>

  * This command will run hasura console locally on your system and you can start your development from there.

    In order to run hasura console you need to run the command in the following pattern:

    <br/>

    ```bash
    $ node glue graphql:console <instance-name> --port <port-number>
    ```

    <br/>

    For example, if you have already created a **Graphql Plugin Instance** with your instance
    name as **graphql** and you want to run hasura console on port **9695**. Then in order to run
    hasura console you need to enter the following command.

    <br/>

    ```bash
    $ node glue graphql:console graphql --port 9695
    ```
    
    <br/>

    **Note:** Passing port number is optional. If you haven't passed the port number
    Then by default it will start running on port 9695.
