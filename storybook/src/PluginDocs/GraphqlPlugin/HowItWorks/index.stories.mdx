# How it works

##

<br/>

* ## Working

  <br/>

  * GraphQL plugin is started by **Glue Backend-Engine plugin**.
  
  <br/>
  
  * **Glue Backend-Engine plugin** runs the graphql engine.
  
  <br/>

  * Your directory stucture for the **graphql plugin instance** should be something
    like this:

    <br/>

    ```jsx
      ðŸ“¦graphql
        â”£ ðŸ“‚metadata
        â”£ ðŸ“‚migrations
        â”£ ðŸ“‚seeds
        â”£ ðŸ“‚tracks
        â”£ ðŸ“œ.env
        â”£ ðŸ“œREADME.md
        â”£ ðŸ“œconfig.yaml
        â”£ ðŸ“œpackage.json
        â”— ðŸ“œrouter.js
    ```
  <br/>
  <br/>
  
  * In order to start this plugin you need to run the following command:

    <br/>
  
    ```bash
    $ node glue develop:up
    ```
    <br/>

    This command will start running the docker image of all the instances 
    and plugin you have created. Here, in this case it start running your
    **graphql plugin instance**.
      
    
    <br/>
    
      
  * You can go to [http://localhost:8080/console](http://localhost:8080/console) and check your hasura console running.
  
  <br/>
  
  * Now you can go to your hasura console running on [http://localhost:8080/console](http://localhost:8080/console) and start your development from there.
  
  <br/>
  
  * In order to know how to start development using hausra you can refer to the hasura documentation. Here is the official link of hasura docs:
  [https://hasura.io/docs/latest/index/](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/index/).
  
  <br/>
  
  
  * In order to use your graphql endpoint to interact with your database by using quries you can go to your hasura console and from there you can pick it up.
  
  <br/>

* ## Instructions to start development with graphql plugin

  <br/>

  * In order to start creating your own tables and schemas, creating RBAC for db interaction, and everything else you need to go to hasura console,
    running on **http://localhost:8080/console** and you can start your development from there.
