# How to Install

To install this plugin, first go to your local terminal and type the following command:

```sh
$ node glue add graphql graphql
```

The **GraphQL plugin instance** name should only be **'graphql'**.

After installing the dependency, it will prompt you to select an instance from the list of **postgres** instances that you have installed. Choose the one that you want to connect your hasura with. In this case, we will connect it with the already installed **postgres instance**.

Option will be something like this:

In my case I have connected it with postgres, as I have already have postgres instance installed.

If the plugin is installed successfully, you can navigate to the **backend** folder and see that a new folder named **services** has been created. Inside this **services** folder, you will find a new folder named after your instance, which in this case is **graphql**. This **graphql** directory contains the folder structure of hasura.

Overall directory path for the graphql instance should be something like this:

```jsx
  ðŸ“‚backend
  â”— ðŸ“‚services
      â”— ðŸ“‚graphql
```
