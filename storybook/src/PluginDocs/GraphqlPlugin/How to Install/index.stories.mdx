# How to install

##

<br/>

* To install this plugin, first go to your local terminal and type the following command:

  <br/>
  
    ```bash
    $ node glue add graphql graphql
    ```
  
  <br/>

  * The **GraphQL plugin instance** name should only be **'graphql'**.

  <br/>


* After installing the dependency, it will prompt you to select an instance from the list of **postgres** instances that you have installed. Choose the one that you want to connect your hasura with. In this case, we will connect it with the already installed **postgres instance**.

  Option will be something like this:
    
    <img src='/assets/graphqlHowToInstall.png'/>
    

  <br/>


* In my case I have connected it with postgres, as I have already have postgres
  instance installed.


  <br/>

* If the plugin is installed successfully, you can navigate to the **backend** folder and see that a new folder named **services** has been created. Inside this **services** folder, you will find a new folder named after your instance, which in this case is **graphql**. This **graphql** directory contains the folder structure of hasura.
  
  Overall directory path for the graphql instance should be something like this:
  
   ```jsx
      ðŸ“‚backend
      â”— ðŸ“‚services
          â”— ðŸ“‚graphql
    ```
