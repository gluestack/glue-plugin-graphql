# How to install

##

<br/>

* First go to your local terminal and type this command in order to install this 
  plugin

  <br/>
  
    ```bash
    $ node glue add graphql <instance-name>
    ```

  <br/>


* For example, In my case I wanted to install **graphql plugin instance** with my instance
  name as **“graphql”**, then I will follow this pattern to install this plugin
  in my app:

  <br/>
  
    ```bash
    $ node glue add graphql graphql
    ```
  
  <br/>

    Here my instance name is **graphql**.

  <br/>


* Now, after installing the dependency it will ask you for selecting an 
  instance which has the option for the list of postgres instances you 
  have installed. Select the one with which you want to connect your hasura.

  Option will be something like this:

  <br/>


* In my case I have connected it with postgres, as I have already have postgres
  instance installed.


  <br/>

* If the plugin is installed successfully then you can go and see that inside 
  **backend** folder there is a folder created named “**functions**” and inside
  that **function** folder a new folder has been created which is named after your
  instance **graphql** is created. In this graphql directory you can see the folder
  structure of hasura.
  
  Overall directory path for the graphql instance should be something like this:
  
  **backend/functions/graphql**
